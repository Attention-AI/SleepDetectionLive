# SleepDetection Live
OpenCV Drowsiness Detector using Python and Dlib
using a dlib library 
features  I am using a point structure face system where I calculated aspect ration for foth yawning and eyes getting close as a normal eye blink would be possible so I kept a time module as a sleep function which will be call at that moment. faur yawning we are getting a perfect data when ever my mouth is open I am getting a output of yawing I am using dlib because I read over the internet we can get this data in csv also for creating model also but the model would require more gpu and space where as opencv and dlib work perfectly for this we can get a data in csv format set a target count the number of yawns call that function in a chart and can establish a accuracy score later on . 

third function needed to be added in this will be a posenet and later that will get a one file will be calling this file functions in a main.py a flask  from there  will be passing a frames .

posenet implication nitya sinha (Needed to complete )...
